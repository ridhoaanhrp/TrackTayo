Telkom University Car Tracking Application

# Description

The Telkom University Car Tracking Application is a sophisticated software solution designed for the real-time monitoring and tracking of Telkom University vehicles.
In this project, collaboration has been fostered among faculty members and students hailing from the Information Technology program within the Faculty of Informatics at Telkom University. This feature has been seamlessly integrated into the MyTel-U application, enhancing its functionality and user experience. I am responsible for consuming Telkom University Car location data from the API for this application.
